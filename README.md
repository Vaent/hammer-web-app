# Hammertime web app

This is a simple app demonstrating techniques learned during an apprenticeship at Makers Academy. It incorporates Sinatra and ERB (embedded Ruby) and includes a Capybara test suite.

The app requests a name from the user through a simple HTML form. When the user clicks the 'Go!' (submit) button, they are redirected to another page which displays an animated gif of a hammer repeatedly bashing the text they entered. CSS animation code is embedded in the HTML of the second page to make the text move in time with the hammer.

The gif was provided for free by www.animatedimages.org

The app has been tested in Chrome 70.0.3538.102, Safari 12.0.1, Firefox 63.0.1; it may not work correctly in older browsers.
